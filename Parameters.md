# Parameters

## Differences between Hyperparameters and Parameters
Parameters
- used to make predictions
- estimated by the model while training
- learned and step up by the model itselfs
- dependent on the dataset
- can be used by optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
- Examples: linear regression, logistics regression, weights
  
Hyperparameters
- used to optimizied the model
- setting set before the model starts the training
- independent of the dataset
- learnign rate
- momentum
