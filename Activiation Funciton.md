Activation Function
: decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. This means that it will decide whether the neuron's input to the network is important or not in the process of prediction

- the purpose of the Activation Function is to derive output from a set of input values fed to a node (layer)

- to transformed the summed weighted input from teh node into an output value to be fed to the next layer

## What is a node?

- a node is a replica of a neuron that receives a set of imput signals - external stimuli

## Purpose of Activation Function

- adds non-linearity to the network
- gives an additional step to each layer's computation
- allows network to perfrom complex tasks
- without activation function, all layers of the neural network would only be able to perform linear regression 

# 3 Types of Neural Networds Activation Functions

1. Binary Step Function
2. Linear Activation Function 
3. Non- Linear Activation Function

## Binary Step Function
- depends onf the threshold value that decides whether a neuron should be activated or not
- input are compared to a certain threshold
- inputs greater than it, then the neuron is activated 
- inputs less than the threshold, network will deactivated. Output will not be passed



## Linear Activation Function
## Non-linear Activation Function
